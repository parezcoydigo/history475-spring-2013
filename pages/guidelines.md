title: Making a better blog
extends: norm.html  

### Overview

For the second half of the semester, I want you to concentrate on making your blog posts better, in both content and form.  

A good blog post is one that everyone wants to read. Even better: after they read it, they feel inspired to recommend it to other readers. What are some ways to make this phenomenon possible?

#### Create a Title, Not a Topic

There is an understandable tendency for students to name posts for their course blogs after the topic of the week, or even more generically as the week number. Let's try to think beyond such an obvious choice and create a title that connects with what you're saying in your post.  


#### Write for an Audience, Not for Yourself

Consider who your audience is for a post written on the web. In reality, there are many audiences -- both connected to this class and in the world beyond. There are: 

professors
classmates
parents
future employers
subjects of your posts
random surfers on the world wide web

In sum, your blog has the potential to garner a huge audience, whereas most assignments written for a course are turned in for the professor's (or TA's) eyes only. 

#### Blog Often, Not Just When You’re Supposed To

Most students will only write a blog post when the syllabus assigns them to. However, good blogging is not about being told what to do. Blog when you have an epiphany, when you have the day off, when you come across a news item that connects with the course, when you can’t think of anything to write about. The more you blog, the more adept you will become at it. Not every blog post needs to be brilliant, but you’re more likely to write a brilliant blog post if you write more of them.

#### Make Your Blog Readable, Not Stay Awayable

Nothing says “please don’t read me” like a big block of text. Remember: most readers will only SCAN your post, so you need to be strategic about what you put where. Readers scan:

titles
subheadings
images
lists
bold text
topic sentences

You want your readers to see your key points right away, so that they will become interested in reading further into your post.

Provide paragraph breaks every time you switch topics, ideas, or angles. Paragraphs don’t have a universal prescribed length; rather, the purpose of a paragraph is to guide your reader through your content, from one point to the next. Smaller paragraphs create more white space on the page–however too many, too short paragraphs are just as difficult to read as a big chunk of text.
