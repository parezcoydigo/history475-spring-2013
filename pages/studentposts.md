*  [Blog 6: A region in conflict](http://onceuponatimetherewereindigenouspeople.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/blog-6-a-region-in-conflict/)-- During the late eighteenth century the Andean regions, that had once been under Inca rule, were going through a period of transition and social reformations of sorts. As discussed in the sources, Eugenio Sinanyuca by Ward Stavig and The Tragedy of Success by Steve J. Stern, there were great injustices suffered by the Indigenous people.

### Indigenous People of Latin America
*  [The Economy, Stupid](http://rachelvol13.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/the-economy-stupid/)-- I&#8217;m beginning to believe that almost every rebellion ever has the economy as one of its root causes. The Andean peoples had long had reason to revolt. As Tupac Amaru himself says to the audiencia of Lima, Native Americans had &#8230; <a href="http://rachelvol13.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/the-economy-stupid/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=rachelvol13.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45489163&#038;post=73&#038;subd=rachelvol13&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### parezco y digo
*  [](http://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/904/)-- Thinking about George Landow&#8217;s observation that,  One might claim to see a parallel between the dotcom bust and the general loss of academic standing by critical theory&#8230;. and [Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, and other critical theorists'] approach to textuality remains very helpful in understanding our experiece of hypermedia.

*  [History 475, Blog 4](http://rockytopranger.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/history-475-blog-4/)-- It is imprudent to say that there is a single indigenous version of the conquest, because every altepetl experienced and participated in the conquest differently. Their differing experiences largely depended on the individual altepetl. &#8230; <a href="http://rockytopranger.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/history-475-blog-4/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=rockytopranger.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45525334&#038;post=127&#038;subd=rockytopranger&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [Week 8 Blog Post](http://athenasowl1.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/week-8-blog-post/)-- This blog will be focusing on two articles, the “Rebellion of Tupac Amaru” by Alberto Galindo and “Eugenio Sinanyuca” written by Ward Stavig. Both of these articles focus on aspects the rebellion lead by Tupac Amaru. I found Alberto Galindo’s description of the ingenious peoples punishment after the rebellion to be quite interesting. He states [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=athenasowl1.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45489166&#038;post=122&#038;subd=athenasowl1&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

One of the first examples to be seen that characterizes this mixing of cultures is in the introduction of Dona Isabel as Hernando Cortez&#8217;s wife. Although it was a forced relationship initiated by the [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=willpatterson1.wordpress.com&#038;blog=39831023&#038;post=212&#038;subd=willpatterson1&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

Tupac Amaru II took his name from his claimed relative, the last Incan monarch (Tupac Amaru) who was killed by the Spanish during the late 16th century.

*  [Assimilation and Exploitation Equal Growth and War](http://cshinklesr2013.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/assimilation-and-exploitation-equal-growth-and-war/)-- In a comparison to the history of England&#8217;s unyielding desire to control its colonies on the eastern coastal areas of North America, the Spanish government seemed to bring about a public outrage and armed resistance as well, and one that could have been the ruination of Spanish control along the western regions of South America.

*  [Week 8 Reading](http://nsprouse.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/week-8-reading/)-- For the indigenous people in 16th and 17th century Spanish-speaking America, to be successful was to convert and conform. Conversion to the Christian religion and adapting the language, culture, and dress of the Spanish was absolutely necessary for economic and social success. To keep the religion, dress, and culture of ones ancestors was to subject [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=nsprouse.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45633871&#038;post=37&#038;subd=nsprouse&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### mesohistoryblog
*  [Colonization](http://mesohistoryblog.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/colonization/)-- There were many philosophical questions covered in La Otra Conquista.  Something I found interesting was what seemed to be the main philosophical question that is still asked today in regards to religion&#8230;What is truth?  The film covers both the Spanish and indigenous forms of truth and goes so far as to make parallels and overlap [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mesohistoryblog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45662303&#038;post=488&#038;subd=mesohistoryblog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [The “Colonized Indian”](http://gohomecolonistsyouredrunk.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/the-colonized-indian/)-- This film introduced many philosophical issues, most notably the conquest of social hierarchy. Essentially, this leads to questions of what compelled the Spanish to convert the indigenous rather than coexist with them? It is interesting to consider that the indigenous &#8230; <a href="http://gohomecolonistsyouredrunk.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/the-colonized-indian/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gohomecolonistsyouredrunk.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45664255&#038;post=151&#038;subd=gohomecolonistsyouredrunk&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

Why did Tupac Amaru begin his revolution? &#160; Articles about the indigenous and the revolt of Tupac Amaru &#160; It seems that Fate dealt the indigenous peoples a losing hand when the Spanish arrived.

### craig04
*  [“Colonized Indian” Questions](http://ecraig3.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/colonized-indian-questions/)-- Over the course of decades, the indigenous groups in New Spain adopted the political way of thinking and acting in order to achieve their goals.  We have learned that the Spanish sought to justify their initial occupation of Central America by writing into law and appealing to the Spanish King to recognize their claim to &#8230; <a class="more-link" href="http://ecraig3.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/colonized-indian-questions/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#187;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ecraig3.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45685354&#038;post=36&#038;subd=ecraig3&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### igotoseekagreatperhaps1
*  [2/25](http://igotoseekagreatperhaps1.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/224/)-- The readings for this week discussed the different ways in which the indigenous people rebelled against the Spanish. Tupac Amaru was the figurehead of the indigenous rebellions as he was traced his lineage back to the last of the Inca nobles.

*  [“Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races”](http://fantasmadecipactli.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/misplaced-hate-makes-disgrace-to-races/)-- The way that I learned about the Spanish conquest of Latin America did not allow for rebellions to take place. I was taught that the indigenous population was completely wiped out but like so many other things we’ve read about, &#8230; <a href="http://fantasmadecipactli.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/misplaced-hate-makes-disgrace-to-races/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=fantasmadecipactli.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45698939&#038;post=21&#038;subd=fantasmadecipactli&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

The Stavig and Sterns articles take the concepts from previous weeks about individual communities and focus their studies on the interactions between individual actors. Stavig points to the importance of “face to [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annawgreene.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45706406&#038;post=34&#038;subd=annawgreene&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [Post 6 [Rebellion articles]](http://mmcginn7.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/post-6-rebellion-articles/)-- Questions for discussion: 1. How does the lack of an en masse rebellion reflect the region&#8217;s early history? 2. Why is the term loyalist applied to neutral parties during the rebellion? What purpose would that serve for rebels? For the Spanish? For the loyalists themselves? 3.

Beyond its structural functions, the employment of stone in Inkan society reflects the profound interconnectedness observed by Inkas between man and the natural environment that surrounds him.
