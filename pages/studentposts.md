*  [Blog Post 5](http://onceuponatimetherewereindigenouspeople.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/blog-post-5/)-- “You turned my people into ashes. Our truth went up in smoke.” Topiltzin, who normally remains silent, tells Friar Diego the injustice he feels that happened with the conquest started. It was one thing to have a military and political conquest but another to try to change the social and religious atmosphere of Mexico.

*  [La Otra Conquista](http://rachelvol13.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/la-otra-conquista/)-- La Otra Conquista is a reflection on the survival of aspects of indigenous religious culture through its union with Spanish Catholic tradition. Weaved through the film is the implication that such a synthesis is possible because, at their core, the &#8230; <a href="http://rachelvol13.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/la-otra-conquista/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=rachelvol13.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45489163&#038;post=71&#038;subd=rachelvol13&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [History 475, Blog 4](http://rockytopranger.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/history-475-blog-4/)-- It is imprudent to say that there is a single indigenous version of the conquest, because every altepetl experienced and participated in the conquest differently. Their differing experiences largely depended on the individual altepetl. &#8230; <a href="http://rockytopranger.wordpress.com/2013/02/11/history-475-blog-4/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=rockytopranger.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45525334&#038;post=127&#038;subd=rockytopranger&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [2/18](http://willpatterson1.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/218/)-- #5 La Otra Conquista  Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, as depicted in the film, was neither annihilation nor complete and utter conquest. One of the first examples to be seen that characterizes this mixing of cultures is in the introduction of Dona Isabel as Hernando Cortez&#8217;s wife.

*  [“Colonized Indian” Questions](http://ecraig3.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/colonized-indian-questions/)-- Over the course of decades, the indigenous groups in New Spain adopted the political way of thinking and acting in order to achieve their goals.  We have learned that the Spanish sought to justify their initial occupation of Central America by writing into law and appealing to the Spanish King to recognize their claim to &#8230; <a class="more-link" href="http://ecraig3.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/colonized-indian-questions/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#187;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ecraig3.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45685354&#038;post=36&#038;subd=ecraig3&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

The Spanish friars were at odds with the indigenous Aztecs, and frequently both sides suffered from “double mistaken identity” – where neither side comprehends the other but each are assured that they are making themselves clear.

The film, La Otra Conquista, does a good job of illustrating the mixing of Aztec and Spanish culture and symbology.
