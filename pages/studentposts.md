### parezco y digo
*  [not @mlajobs, no really](http://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/not-mlajobs-no-really/)-- Early this Fall, I wrote a few pieces about the scurrilous formalization of the expiring PhD. In the wake of the furor caused by the ad from Colorado State, and another from Harvard, much virtual ink was spilt, some of it quite funny. This evening, a retweet originating with Brian Croxall came across my feed [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=parezcoydigo.wordpress.com&#038;blog=3594723&#038;post=894&#038;subd=parezcoydigo&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### rockytopranger
*  [History 475, Blog 1](http://rockytopranger.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/history-475-blog-1/)-- Studying the cultural aspects of indigenous Mesoamericans through our westernized lenses often causes us to make false assumptions. What seems to us as logical inferences about the importance, or meaning, of an Inkan temple &#8230; <a href="http://rockytopranger.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/history-475-blog-1/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=rockytopranger.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45525334&#038;post=2&#038;subd=rockytopranger&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### athenasowl1
*  [Stones and Voices](http://athenasowl1.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/stones-and-voices/)-- After reading the back of Carolyn Dean’s A Culture of Stone, I was both intrigued and perplexed by what her book was analyzing. I was not sure if I would find an analysis of stone interesting; however, once I began reading I found her book to be very thought provoking. I was quite interested in [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=athenasowl1.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45489166&#038;post=4&#038;subd=athenasowl1&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### willpatterson1
*  [1/21](http://willpatterson1.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/121/)-- It is very evident that, especially through Mesoamerica text, the authors are upfront and persistent on preserving the complexity, humanity, and distinctions of Mesoamerican groups. By stating that, &#8220;But in their own language, people referred to themselves as tay fludzahui, or &#8220;people of the rain place,&#8221; or &#8220;people of the  Dzahui&#8221;, the rain deity (Meso 5) the authors, also [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=willpatterson1.wordpress.com&#038;blog=39831023&#038;post=19&#038;subd=willpatterson1&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### moconn475
*  [Hist475 First weekly blog post](http://moconn475.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/hist475-first-weekly-blog-post/)-- Carolyn Dean&#8217;s A Culture of Stone: Inka Perspectives on Rock describes the importance of stone for Inca spiritual and cultural life. In the introduction, Dean is focused on describing how Western scholars do not fully understand how the the Inca viewed stone. She explains how this can be traced historically to Spanish colonists and missionaries [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=moconn475.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45543569&#038;post=2&#038;subd=moconn475&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### cshinklesr2013
*  [Did Religion Cause Conquest?](http://cshinklesr2013.wordpress.com/2013/01/20/did-religion-cause-conquest/)-- Religion, this single word has been the very root of cultures across the timeline of human existence and scapegoat of disagreements between those cultures as well. But did the conquistadors of Spain which Cortez led in 1519CE view indigenous people&#8217;s inferior because of religion, or could it have been something else? Throughout history humans have [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=cshinklesr2013.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45548793&#038;post=3&#038;subd=cshinklesr2013&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### It's a blog about history
*  [Mesoamerican Voices, Chapters 1, 2, and 9 || A Culture of Stone, pgs. 1-64](http://nsprouse.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/mesoamerican-voices-chapters-1-2-and-9-a-culture-of-stone-pgs-1-64/)-- I found this week&#8217;s reading in A Culture of Stone and Mesoamerican Voices to be very interesting. Since I read from Mesoamerican Voices first, I will comment on that first. First to be said about Mesoamerican Voices is that it is extremely informative (As it should be). In the first 20 pages (Chapters 1 and [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=nsprouse.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45633871&#038;post=4&#038;subd=nsprouse&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### mesohistoryblog
*  [Reading week 3](http://mesohistoryblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/reading-week-3/)-- For this week, I mostly focused on the reading from Mesoamerican Voices.  The excerpts from the book were highly informative of sixteenth century Mesoamerica.  Although some backstory on pre-colonial times was provided much of the information was dictated by literacy of the indigenous people and focused on their writings as written in the Roman alphabet.  I [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mesohistoryblog.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45662303&#038;post=3&#038;subd=mesohistoryblog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### gohomecolonistsyouredrunk
*  [Indigenous Societies I](http://gohomecolonistsyouredrunk.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/indigenous-societies-i/)-- To suggest that the modern understanding of indigenous peoples and societies is widely misunderstood would be an understatement. In a recent discussion, it was established that the common interpretation of &#8221;Indians&#8221; involves that of a group of people who often wore feathers, lived in &#8230; <a href="http://gohomecolonistsyouredrunk.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/indigenous-societies-i/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gohomecolonistsyouredrunk.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45664255&#038;post=48&#038;subd=gohomecolonistsyouredrunk&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### gorillawarfare475
*  [Mesoamerican Rocks](http://gorillawarfare475.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/mesoamerican-rocks/)-- Mesoamerican Voices chapters 1-2 (my book hasn’t come in yet, so I couldn’t read chapter 9) The authors of this work compare and contrast the people of Mesoamerica with each other and with the invading Spaniards. When speaking about the indigenous peoples, they don’t advocate for one culture over the other. Rather, they inform the [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gorillawarfare475.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45683850&#038;post=3&#038;subd=gorillawarfare475&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### craig04
*  [Mesoamerican literary excellence](http://ecraig3.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/mesoamerican-literary-excellence/)-- According to Mesoamerican Voices, the native people in the region, more notably the Nahuas, Mixtecans, and Yucatans, wrote with a fine reverence for politics, morality, family, religion, and family wills.  There are a number of written articles which have survived over the years which display the literary excellence that Mesoamerica contained in the pre and &#8230; <a class="more-link" href="http://ecraig3.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/mesoamerican-literary-excellence/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#187;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=ecraig3.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45685354&#038;post=3&#038;subd=ecraig3&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### dymer3
*  [](http://dymer3.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/2/)-- One question I have is about the structure of pre-Hispanic Andean society, which I’ve only briefly studied in my previous Latin American Studies classes. How hierarchical was it? Was there a great division of labor?  Were there specific &#8230; <a href="http://dymer3.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/2/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=dymer3.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45686064&#038;post=2&#038;subd=dymer3&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### igotoseekagreatperhaps1
*  [](http://igotoseekagreatperhaps1.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/3/)-- The first readings from Mesoamerican Voices show a unique look at native Latin American history through the lens of the indigenous peoples themselves. With the various primary sources translated into English, this book gives the reader a different perspective other than the typical secondary view. This work is structured topically. Chapter one discusses the Mesoamericans [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=igotoseekagreatperhaps1.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45686604&#038;post=3&#038;subd=igotoseekagreatperhaps1&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### Fantasma De Cipactli
*  [Learning and Remembering](http://fantasmadecipactli.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/learning-and-remembering/)-- When looking at ancient cultures and their artwork made for deities, I often find myself thinking of the Greeks and Romans and their magnificent statues, buildings, and other man-made works of art as the “normal.” Reading the beginning of A &#8230; <a href="http://fantasmadecipactli.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/learning-and-remembering/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=fantasmadecipactli.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45698939&#038;post=3&#038;subd=fantasmadecipactli&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### annawgreene
*  [Climbing an Intellectual Mountain](http://annawgreene.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/climbing-an-intellectual-mountain/)-- Last semester, I had a great Women’s Studies professor who encouraged her students to write diaries. As she could not ethically check this assignment, she was never able to require it, but her point was simple: when people read about us in the future, they will get it all wrong unless their subjects left frank, [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annawgreene.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45706406&#038;post=3&#038;subd=annawgreene&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [Thoughts on the Week Three readings](http://lasindigenas.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/thoughts-on-the-week-three-readings/)-- The readings for this week were the introduction and the first chapter of Carolyn Dean’s A Culture of Stone and chapters one, two, and nine of Mesoamerican Voices, edited by Matthew Restall, Lisa Sousa, Kevin Terraciano.             Culture of Stone begins with Dean introducing the purpose of her examination of [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=lasindigenas.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45743186&#038;post=3&#038;subd=lasindigenas&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

### mmcginn7
*  [Week 2: Mesoamerican Voices(1,2,9) and A Culture of Stone(pp1-64)](http://mmcginn7.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/week-2-mesoamerican-voices129-and-a-culture-of-stonepp1-64/)-- The overarching themes in this week&#8217;s readings, in addition to Les Field&#8217;s article from Current Anthropology, introduce the difficulties in defining a general Andean culture or a Mesoamerican worldview from largely incompatible Western perspectives; or more appropriately, any perspective that is not true to the heart and diversity of those Mesoamericans. In Mesoamerican Voices, the author opens with [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mmcginn7.wordpress.com&#038;blog=45749097&#038;post=218&#038;subd=mmcginn7&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />

*  [Leave no Stone Unturned: ‘Coming to terms’ with Inkan Spirituality](http://jperugin.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/leave-no-stone-unturned-coming-to-terms-with-inkan-spirituality/)-- My inaugural blog following the &#8216;inaugural weekend&#8217; delves into murky, uncharted territory for me, into a subject that author and art historian Carolyn Dean proclaims that “the West has literally never come to terms with” (Dean 19).
