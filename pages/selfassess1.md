title: first blog self assessment
extends:  norm.html

Consider the posts you've written thus far this semester. We are at Week 8, so you should have seven unless your group has already presented, in which case you should have six! I would like you to grade each of your on a 1-4 scale, 4 being this best. For guidance, refer to this [rubric](/rubric). Your self-assessment will inform my assessment of your posts through mid-term. (Keep in mind that I will look more kindly upon an honest assessment.)
