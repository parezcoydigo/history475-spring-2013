### About  
Before 1492, there were no Indians in America.  Columbus’ notorious expedition brought 
not only Europeans to America, it also brought the “Indian.”  Disparate native peoples, with 
different cultures and languages, living in roaming bands and settled empires, located on 
islands, mountains, deserts, and tropical forests would all, after 1492, be called Indians.  The 
origin of the “Indian” lies in this infamous crossing of the Atlantic by Europeans. For 
indigenous groups and individuals, however, crossing between ethnic identities would not 
cease; for some it would even be a daily occurrence.  

In this course, we will examine how indigenous and European peoples understood, maintained, and dismantled ethnic identities 
from pre-Hispanic to modern times in Latin America. We will begin by looking at 
indigenous societies before Spanish conquest and then explore the political, economic, and 
social strategies of indigenous peoples during the colonial and modern eras. We will consider 
how indigenous and non-indigenous peoples used ethnic categories to construct power and
authority.  

The central idea of the course is that ethnic identities are interconnected with 
gender and class and that we therefore have to move away from essentialist approaches and 
ask how and why, at a certain time and place, a particular group chooses to define itself, or is 
defined by others in terms of ethnicity, gender or class.

**Course Objectives**:   

1.  To introduce the students to the origin of the term "Indian" and its relationship to systems of colonial and national domination. In problematizing that term, students will investigate the relationship between categories of domination and political struggle.   
2.  To document the multiplicity of indigenous societies in Spanish America, and their trajectories from the pre-conquest period through the current day.  
3.  To help students better understand the relationship between important historical concepts such as agency and structure, culture and power.  
4.  To help students understand some historical approaches to asking and answering questions, including:  
    * How to identify, closely read, and analyze primary sources.  
    * How to work with and evaluate useful secondary sources, specifically identifying and evaluating their central arguments.  
    * How to work with non-written sources (including images and artifacts).  
5.  To understand and appreciate ambiguity in historical argument and presentation.  
6.  To encourage students to hone their skills at collaboratively posing and solving problems.
