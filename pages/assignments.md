 This course is designed in part for you to experience what it is that historians do, and how they do it. We won't have an archival component, largely because of the language requirements of the primary sources. But, I would encourage anyone with reading knowledge of Spanish to consider using Spanish-language primary materials. The topic selection is open ended, and you can research and write on anything related to the history of Indigenous people in Spanish-speaking Latin America (including the US Southwest up to the 19th century). I would encourage you to read widely, be curious, and get caught up in your topic. At its base, the historical endeavor is about reading, analysing, and writing about textual evidence. So, get ready to read, write, and talk! A lot.
