### Contacting Me
If you have questions or need help at any time, I happy to assist you. My office hours (Wednesdays, 1:30-3:30 pm) are open door. Or, you may make an appointment with me. I commute to Knoxville weekly from Baltimore, MD. I am in town every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. If we cannot schedule a meeting during that time, we can make arrangements for a phone or skype meeting, or via google chat. E-mail is the very best way to communicate with me. I make every attempt to answer your e-mail in a timely fashion, as long as they adhere to certain simple rules of courtesy and professionalism. E-mails that I receive that have no salutation (at a minimum “Hello, Prof. Black” or, more formally, “Dear Prof. Black”) will go unanswered. Nor will I respond to involved inquiries over e-mail. If your question involves much more than a “yes” or “no” answer, please come and see me in office hours. Lastly, if the answer to your question can be found simply by reading the syllabus, you should not expect a response from me.
